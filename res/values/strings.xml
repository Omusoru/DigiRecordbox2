		About Digi Recordbox\n
	</string>
	<string name="about_content1">
	    Digi Recordbox allows the recording of audio notes which are then uploaded and stored on the Digi Storage cloud service. \n
	    After uploading the first recording, a new folder named "Digi Recordbox" will be created in the existing root folder "Digi cloud"
	    associated with your Digi Storage account.\n
		The audio notes can then be played back, either directly from the device\'s local storage, or by streaming them from the cloud. \n\n

	    Instructions\n
	</string>
	<string name="about_content3">
	    - Start recording by pressing the record button in the main screen.\n
		- You can pause and resume recording by pressing the same button.\n
		- When you are done recording, pressing the stop button will present you a new screen 
		 where you can enter a name and a description for the audio note.\n
		- After entering the name and the description, you can either just save and go back
		 to the main screen, or save and them immediately open the audio note in the
		 media player.\n
		- You can access the list of audio notes saved locally and/or on the cloud by pressing the 
		device\'s menu button (if the device doesn\'t have a physical menu button, a menu icon
		will show up on the top action bar) and selecting "Recording list".\n
		- Besides the name, description and duration of the recording, you\'ll also notice
		 two small circles. The first one will color green when the file is present on the local
		 storage and the second one will color blue when the file is stored in the cloud.\n
		- From here you can click on a note and open it in the media player. \n
		- Long pressing on the audio note will open up a context menu from where you can perform
		 different actions like deleting and uploading recordings.\n
